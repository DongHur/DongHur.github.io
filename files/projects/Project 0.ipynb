    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language that is arguable one of the most used language for data analysis apart from Matlab and R. Unlike Matlab and R, Python does not come with a lot of built in packages and functions. However, Python does allow you to easily install and import external packages, giving you the flexibility to use other's code with little effort. Python is also an open-source programming language, allowing people to program without any cost and use packages for free! Lastly, Python has many packages for machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis growing by the day with a very active community to help you with any questions. Learning this general-purpose programming language will serve you well as you go into the field of research and tech jobs (particular data-science).\n",
