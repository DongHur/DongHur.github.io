  <h2>Welcome to Neuro 121</h2>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> In this course, we will introduce students to the study of animal behavior using modern computational tools. Importantly, we aim to make this introduction as democratic as possible by allowing students to collect data easily at their own pace and place, analyze the data using open-source software and interpret the results in the context of prior scholarly literature that is easily accessible.</p>
